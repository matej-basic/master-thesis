# Master thesis

This repository contains everything regarding my master thesis.  
The thesis is titled "Comparing price to performance ratio of Serverless services in public cloud".

The premise of this thesis is to explore the world of serverless services and appropriate programming languages, frameworks and other tools used at the time of writting this thesis (Summer / Fall 2023).  
This is not a one size fits all solution, but I will give insight on how I felt using each platform and tool from a standpoint of a Systems engineer / DevOps engineer.
